# Hack-the-Valley-5-Explore-the-World
## Inspiration
The pandemic has caused us to be unable to travel internationally and see what other cities had to offer. We got introduced to EchoAR during this Hackathon and it seemed really cool and easy to use. So, we decided to explore the world ourselves by creating a program that brought the creations to you.

## What it does
We offer the user choices of different cities to explore. When the user selects a city, they can scan a QR code which will allow them to see what the city has to offer in AR.

## How we built it
We used Java and EchoAR. With JOptionPane, we were able to integrate the QR codes into our program.

## Challenges we ran into
Since we aren't able to create our own models, we have to look at community created ones. These vary in quality, so we decided to cut some that we didn't think would be a good fit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to implement AR into our Java program. We haven't coded in Java for long so we are very happy they we were able to combine our current knowledge to do something we haven't done before.

## What we learned
We learned that JOptionPanes could also be used to display useful information such as QR codes. We also learned that if you want a model done right, you got to do it yourself.

## What's next for Explore the World
We'd like to create our own models for the program. The City of Toronto has high quality 3D models available online, and James already formatted some of them into usable STL files. In the future, we might have a Toronto focused program that would allow you to explore the different areas of Toronto in AR.

## Built With
EchoAR, Java, and love
